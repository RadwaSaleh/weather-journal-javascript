# Weather Journal

A sample project to demonstrate the ability to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data
 to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App.


The project consists of 2 main parts.
1- Client Side
* index.html: contains the HTML elements.
* styles.css: element styling sheet.
* app.js: contains APIs calls and promise chaining.

2- Server Side
* server.js: contains the APIs path and definition.

##Installation
*node
*packages (Express, Body-Parser, and Cors)
*nodemon (so you don't have to stop and start server with every change)

## Run
nodemon server.js
then open http://localhost:63342/ on the browser
